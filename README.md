# sos-game
takes the dimensions of a rectangle and builds the corresponding table from lists. It will then find the number of spaces and fill half of them with S and half with O at random (rounding up). The goal is to count how many times the SOS appears horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The program is rerun 100 times (for the same dimensions) and returns the average of the SOS triples.
